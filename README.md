# How to run

The script resets on restart and kills all geth/beacon/validator!
To run or restart from scratch:
```
run.sh
```

To shutdown:
```
stop.sh
```

Simple run just starts geth and 2 prysm.
To run an additional execution client (like Nethermind):
- change ports to be different from 8545/8551 used by geth
- set proper replacement, see "# REPLACE IN GENESIS CONFIG" in run.sh
- set ELPORT pointing JsonRPC endpoint for EL <-> CL communication(I set to 8552), initially it points to the same geth
- start it only when run.sh finishes, which means that Geth and 2 Prysms have started 

It runs to 0x9 block, waits a bit and merges
